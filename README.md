Welcome. This is a repository for studying incompressible flow solvers.

Pressure-Poisson
----------------
- The method of Harlow & Welch from 1965 also called the Marker-and-Cell approach.

Streamfunction-Vorticity Formulation
------------------------------------
- The method uses a change of variables from primitive to psi and omega fields

Vector-Potential Vorticity Formulation
--------------------------------------
- Extension to 3D. Aziz and Hellums initially propose. Solve three vector-potential Poisson equations for psi. Then solve the vorticity transport equation which includes the vortex stretching term.
