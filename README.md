Welcome. This is a repository for storing files related to the numerical 
modelling of incomrpessinle flows as part of my MSc at Cranfield University.
This repository contains the following files:

* Practice Fortran programmes.
* AC solver for a 2D channel
* FS-PP solver for a 2D channel
* SIMPLE solver for incompressible lid-driven cavity flow
